    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the past decade, data science has emerged as a leading field of study and industry. Data analysis has become critical in tackling societal problems and \n",
    "tracking certain trends in order to arrive at informed, logical solutions. For our final project, we have decided to study New Orleans income and property data \n",
    "to identify the prevalence of gentrification in different neighborhoods. As Tulane students, it is easy to become trapped in the uptown bubble and forget about the \n",
    "impact we have on the rest of the cityâ€™s people, economy, and culture. It is no secret that New Orleans as a whole is a victim of gentrification. Part of what makes \n",
    "the city so unique is its rich history and resilience, something to which none of the 13,000 people from out of state who have moved here from 2012-2016 can bear \n",
    "witness. That being said, our goal for this project is to find meaningful insights in our datasets which we can offer to our partners, hopefully inspiring positive \n",
    "changes in New Orleans.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, one of the datasets we hoped to get our hands on was property value data. Looking at housing prices would allow us take a holistic look at gentrification\n",
    "and possibly track the movement of affluent people to previously poorer neighborhoods. Unfortunately, property value data is notoriously hard to collect in New \n",
    "Orleans. Because of this, the first dataset we analyzed involves poverty rates and income data. To this end, we found census data from the years 2010-2018 which estimates \n",
    "the median income and poverty rate of every county in the USA. Another dataset we decided to look into is a census tract dataset containing both racial and income data. Finally, a third dataset we are looking at analyzes similar statistics from a level of different neighborhoods in and around New Orleans. We hope to use this data in conjunction with \n",
    "the previously discussed census data in order to show how gentrification changes the make-up of neighborhoods. Ideally, we would like to show where the displaced \n",
    "citizens moved after their neighborhoods were gentrified. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two datasets we decided to load into our notebook for this milestone contain the average income and racial makeup for each census tract and each neighborhood. Loading this datasets \n",
    "came with a host of struggles. The biggest struggle was changing all of the column names such that they were sensical and easy to manipulate.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of our meeting plan, we have set weekly meetings on Mondays at 1pm to analyze our progress and plan for any upcoming due dates or milestones. Depending on \n",
    "our availability and wellbeing, we have decided to meet in person in the library to avoid technological complications. In the event that we need to meet virtually, we will maintain these meeting times via Zoom. For any code we are writing for the final project, we will do so in our private GitHub repo attached to our final project page. We have already established that both of us are able to connect, pull, and push to it from our local machines."
